##  About Us

**AIM BRAIN** (King’s Neuromodulation Epilepsy Research Team) at King’s College London is dedicated to advancing **neuromodulation** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** to better understand, detect, and treat **epilepsy**. By combining invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology (EEG, SEEG) with state-of-the-art AI and machine learning, our multidisciplinary team develops tools and insights for:

- **Closed-loop neuromodulation**: Real-time biomarkers and interventions for seizure suppression  
- **Network mapping**: Modeling neuronal connectivity and dynamics underlying epilepsy  
- **AI-powered insights**: Seizure detection, prediction, and personalized modelling  
- **Clinical translation**: Bridging fundamental neuroscience with patient-focused therapy and trials

##  Our Mission

We aim to accelerate translational epilepsy research by:
1. Designing data-driven neuromodulation strategies.
2. Developing scalable AI tools for electrophysiological analysis.
3. Maintaining an open science ethos—sharing datasets, protocols, and software.
4. Nurturing academic and clinical collaborators across King’s Health Partners and beyond.
